# 🎵 Spotify Clone

A **frontend Spotify Clone** built using **React + Vite** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
This project replicates the look and feel of Spotify’s web interface — including playlists, albums, and music player layout — as part of my journey to **upskill in React and Tailwind CSS**.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- ⚛️ **React (Vite)** — for fast and modular frontend development  
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** — for beautiful, responsive UI styling  
- 💻 **JavaScript (ES6)** — for component logic and interactivity  

---

## 🧩 Features

- 🎶 Spotify-like clean and modern UI  
- 🖼️ Album and playlist view layout  
- 💚 Music player section design  
- 🌙 Dark theme with responsive styling  


> Note: This project currently focuses only on **frontend UI**.  
> Backend and music playback functionalities are not yet implemented — as this project was created mainly for **React + Tailwind skill development**.
